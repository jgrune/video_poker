## Technical Requirements
Performing/Excelling - Great work leveraging sessions and CRUD to create a poker game. I would encourage you into looking into a deck model and creating encryption for your user authentication.

## Creativity/Interface
Performing/Excelling - Cool game! Really unique idea for a project 2. Very cool interface with the leaderboard functionality. Now that we're learning about spas, what of this functionality needs to transition in order for you to make that happen?

## Code Quality
Excelling - Really great job abstracting functionality away from controllers and fleshing out model definitions. I would encourage you to do even more. Abstracting out deck functionality. You could even make a Game class that has all the "predefined" things about poker.

## Functionality
Performing - Everything works exactly as you'd expect. There is the one minor bug when you try to trade all your cards in.
